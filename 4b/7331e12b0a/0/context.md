### Prompt 1

Implement the following plan:

# Fireside Rebrand Plan

## Context

The project's GitHub repo is already named "Fireside" and the README uses the Fireside name, but all internal code, configs, and deployment scripts still use "yankcord" / "Yankcord" / "YANKCORD". This plan renames every occurrence to "fireside" / "Fireside" / "FIRESIDE" for a complete, clean rebrand. The live `server/.env` file is intentionally excluded.

**Scope:** ~38 files + 1 directory rename, ~133 individual edits.
