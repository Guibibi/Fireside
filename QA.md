Manual, human-run verification tasks go here.

## Pending

- (none)

## Completed

- Track A codec QA matrix passed: validated Auto/AV1/VP9/VP8/H264 screen-share flows in Tauri and browser fallback paths.
- Native share UI capability gating verified: disabled codec options matched real runtime capability on target machines.
- AV1 readiness graduation gate passed: manual AV1 share sessions on target platforms met telemetry stability expectations and showed no repeat startup failure/crash pattern in a 30-minute session.
- Phase 5.7: Per-voice-channel codec configuration: create voice channel with custom bitrate, DTX, and FEC settings; join voice and verify codec parameters applied correctly.
