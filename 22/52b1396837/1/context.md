## User Prompts

### Prompt 1

We're having a big problem with the voice chat functionality that is affecting thousand of users. I do not know the root cause, but it seems that users using the tauri app cannot hear anyone else. Their microphone seems to be transmitting (green light is going on) but they can't hear nobody

### Prompt 2

Could we handle audio natively? Would we have any kind of advatange doing it?

### Prompt 3

Well nevermind, for the warning we added, could we popup the audio ask gesture? Or add a button in the UI for it? Something like fix audio permissions

### Prompt 4

[Request interrupted by user for tool use]

### Prompt 5

Yes please do that change and continue

### Prompt 6

I need you to git commit this, tag it with the next release and then push it
